# File Away

A web service that allows users to upload a file which is made available again, only after the designated date and time is reached.

## Requirements

Needs the following packages installed:

*   python3
*   sqlite

## Usage

Simply run the server.py script. Thats it!

It serves to port 8080 by default so you will need to reroute to port 80 or change some code if you want to run in production.
