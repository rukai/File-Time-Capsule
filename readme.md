# File Time Capsule

A web service that allows users to upload a file which is made available again, only after the designated date and time is reached.

## Requirements

Needs the following packages installed:

*   Python3
*   SQLite (Python3 binding)
*   Tornado (Python3)

## Usage
First run `./generateDB.py`, then run `./server.py`.

It serves to port 8080 by default so you will need to reroute to port 80 or change some code + run under root if you want to run in production.

## Licence

Licenced under GPL v3, check the included licence file for more information.
